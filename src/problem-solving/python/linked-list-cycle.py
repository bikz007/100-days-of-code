"""
Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a function to determine if the LinkedList has a cycle in it or not.
Example-1

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

Example-2:

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

Example-3:

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```
